      "subheading": "For absolutely everybody. Half days are our most popular option.",
      "description": "Enough time for significant progress, not too much to wear you out. Half day lessons (especially in our 4-day courses!) give you the opportunity to combine learning with an instructor and practicing on your own. A half day is enough time to thoroughly work on the aspects of your technique which most need improvement, and you’ll have the other half of the day to practice at your own pace and be in tiptop shape for the next lesson. We recommend a 4 × half day course as a minimum for first-time skiers and snowboarders to become confident and able to safely explore the slopes on their own, and a 4 × full day course is best for skiers who want to successfully make parallel turns and snowboarders to link their turns down intermediate slopes.

A lot of progress can be made in a full day of skiing with an instructor! The fastest learners are often skiing intermediate slopes by the end of their first full day lesson, and it’s not uncommon to go from zero to racing down advanced slopes by the end of a 4 × full day course. If you are motivated to enjoy skiing to its fullest as quickly as possible, this course is for you.",
